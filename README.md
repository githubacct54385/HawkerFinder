# HawkerFinder

## This is in progress.  Not complete

As a new resident in Singapore, finding something cheap to eat is usually on my mind.  I typically use Google maps to find the closest hawker centres.  I'm hoping to make this web app to help me find the closest hawker centres to my location or any given location.  I want to build on this if possible to show what is available at each hawker centre.  That's down the line though.

Uses [Google Maps API Wrapper for C#](https://github.com/maximn/google-maps) for geocoding addresses.  I found this easier than writing my own queries.
